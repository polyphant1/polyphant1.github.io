excerpt: Reflections on a conference in Muizenberg, hosted by the University of Western Cape
---

I was fortunate enough a couple of weeks ago to be invited by my supervisor to a conference in Cape Town, hosted by the University of Western Cape. This was my first venture in to the southern hemisphere, and my second to the African continent (I visited Morocco a few years ago). For the conference I was joined by colleagues from the University of Sussex, as well as Oxford University and the University of Cape Town.

I was unsure what to expect from South Africa. I knew the basic story of the countries eventually successful struggle through apartheid, and even vaguer notions of the far earlier Boer and Zulu wars, so I decided to brush up on the history and purchased '[A History of South Africa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/706151.A_History_of_South_Africa)' by Frank Welsh. I wouldn't recommend it; the narration is pretty dry, and the complex array of names and places aren't made any easier to remember by Welsh's tendency to flit between slang and nicknames. However it did give me a better grasp of the background to the 'rainbow nation' before this very brief visit to the countries capital.

South Africa is a country in transition. A quarter of a century after the fall of apartheid, the social and economic impact of that appalling policy is still evident today. In the taxi from the airport we passed shack towns, some burning; as police and fire services struggled to tackle the blaze, crowds looked on from motorway overpasses. Our destination, the seaside resort of Muizenberg known as 'the Brighton of South Africa', with its population of surfers and beach goers, felt very far removed from the chaos we witnessed on the drive in.

The landscape of the city is breathtaking. Unfortunately a trip to table mountain was scuppered by early morning cloud, but we still got a reasonably good look at the city from on the hill, as the clouds rolled and piled in to the mountain side.

One of the more statistically unlikely dangers around the Cape, but one that illicits a unique fear, is that of Shark attack. Attacks on beaches around the cape have been on the rise in recent years, encouraged by shark baiters attracting the animals in to shallower waters for tourist boat tours. To counter this the local government has introduced shark watches on popular beaches, with a series of flags indicating the danger level similar to lifeguard flags on less exotic European beaches.

On a small patch of beach and rock on the long southern arm of the cape lives another animal that I didn't associate with Africa: Penguins. The [African Penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_penguin), otherwise known as the jackass penguin, has been pinned down to a few small islands off the south western coast of Africa. The population has declined from a few million at the start of the 20th century down to just ~55000 in 2010; if you extrapolate that trend, they will be extinct within 15 years. I don't condone protecting cute animals over their ugly competitors, but the world would be a far poorer place without the bray of the jackass penguin.

The quote from the title of this post is from a book I found in a quaint little shop in Muizenberg itself. [Rattlesnake books](http://www.rattlesnakebooks.com/) specialises in Africana books, art and ephemera, and the proprietor was kind enough to let me photograph some of the wonderful objects he had on display. If you're ever in Cape Town check it out!
