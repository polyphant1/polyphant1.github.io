> *I have a bad habit of keeping lots of interesting research papers open in a long line of tabs in my browser. I am loath to close any of them, but the sight of it is not good for my well being every time I want to browse the internet. To alleviate my suffering, from now on I endeavour to read at least one each weekday, and blog a brief summary. These summaries do not represent an endorsement of the research contained in the chosen paper, and the choice is arbitrary based on what I find interesting on a given day. Any of the content is liable to misinterpretation or misrepresentation: if you want to know exactly what the authors said, go check out the paper and make your own mind up.*

### [Coevolution of metallicity and star formation in galaxies to z ~ 3.7: I. A Fundamental Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05417v1)

Today's paper uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify a fundamental plane of metallicity (FPZ) in the 3D stellar mass, star formation rate and metallicity space. These parameters are causally related, so we should expect to find correlations between them. In the authors words:

> "Given the causal relationship between star-formation processes and metal content in galaxies, it is not suprising that $M_{*}$, SFR and O/H are mutually correlated"

This work extends a previous analysis by the authors by including higher redshift samples with a common metallicity calibration, called the MEGA dataset (Metallicity Evolution and Galaxy Assembly). They use this to investigate the redshift evolution of these parameters. At higher redshifts we see that SFR increases and metallicity decreases, but whether this is a causal relationship is unclear.

Scaling relations between pairs of variables have been extensively studied, and the authors explore these relations in their dataset. The mass-metallicity relation, MZR, shows a universal decrease in metallicity at a given mass with increasing redshift. The main-sequence of star formation, SFMS, shows that for a given stellar mass the sSFR increases with increasing redshift. Finally, sSFR at a given metallicity is higher at higher redshifts, but the correlation between the two apparent at low redshift disappears at high redshift.

They then fit PCA to the 3D space, noting that the space is truly planar: the first and second eigenvectors contain the majority of the variance, and the third is significantly smaller. Metallicity is only dominant in the third eigenvector, which suggests both that it is dependent on SFR and $M_{*}$, and that the 3D space is degenerate: only two parameters are required to describe galaxy properties.

*sSFR against metallicity for different redshift bins for the MEGA sample*

The PCA model predicts as well as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). They also find little redshift evolution in the FPZ, and conclude from this that the *'opposing redshift trends of O/H (metallicity) and SFR must somehow be mutually compensated'*.

They find little evidence for a star formation main sequence within individual redshift bins, but attribute this to selection effects equivalent to a Malmquist bias. They finally assess the redshift invariance of the FPZ through multi-variable linear regression for metallicity and sSFR as functions of $M_{*}$ and redshift, and conclude that it is redshift invariant.
