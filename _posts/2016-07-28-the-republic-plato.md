If it wasn't for its place in history, and the controversial, forward thinking nature of the ideas Plato raises, this would have got two stars. It's a frustrating book to read; many of the arguments don't stack up, or conflict with earlier assertions. The Socratic dialogue style can get very tiresome to read after a while (why is it necessary to have the interlocutor interject with agreement after every single phrase?!) And Socrates comes across as a bit of a jerk, so it's hard to get behind the main 'character'. I had to keep reminding myself that this was written around two and a half thousand years ago, and basically to cut Plato some slack.

I can't comment on the translation from Desmond Lee without an understanding of the source, but there are enlightening comments throughout, revealing any ambiguities he had to deal with. It also helped one to take the perspective of interpretation, both in terms of language and philosophy.

There are also some cracking quotes, that appeared hauntingly relevant to the chaotic political world of 2016, such as

> "Any extreme is liable to produce a violent reaction; this is as true of the weather and plants and animals as of political societies"

As an Astrophysicist, Plato's discussion of Astronomy, whilst being in terms of an education for his philosophic guardians, was hilarious out of context.

> "I think you’ve a really high-class idea of the study of “higher things”,’ I replied. ‘Perhaps you think that anyone who puts his head back and gazes at a painted ceiling learns something and is using his mind and not his eyes. You may be right, and I may be just simple minded, but I can’t believe that the mind is made to look upwards except by studying the real and the invisible. If anyone tries to learn anything about the world of sense whether by gaping upwards or blinking downwards, I don’t reckon that he really learns – there is no knowledge to be had of such things – nor do I reckon his mind is directed upwards, even if he’s lying on his back or floating on the sea."

> "We shall therefore treat astronomy, like geometry, as setting us problems for solution,’ I said, ‘and ignore the visible heavens, if we want to make a genuine study of the subject and use it to convert the mind’s natural intelligence to a useful purpose."
