> *I have a bad habit of keeping lots of interesting research papers open in a long line of tabs in my browser. I am loath to close any of them, but the sight of it is not good for my well being every time I want to browse the internet. To alleviate my suffering, from now on I endeavour to read at least one each weekday, and blog a brief summary. These summaries do not represent an endorsement of the research contained in the chosen paper, and the choice is arbitrary based on what I find interesting on a given day. Any of the content is liable to misinterpretation or misrepresentation: if you want to know exactly what the authors said, go check out the paper and make your own mind up.*

### [The hierarchical formation of BCGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606519)

Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) are the big, bright central galaxies in a dark matter halo. In $\Lambda$CDM, clusters assemble late through mergers - it’s only at high redshift that cooling flows lead to significant galaxy growth. This paper looks at a Semi-Analytic Model run on the merger trees of the Millenium simulation and analyses the properties of its BCGs.

#### Mergers in the SAM
When a subhalo merges with the FOF group of the BCG, it’s only once the subhalo dissolves into the FOF group that its galaxies become part of the main FOF halo, and eventually merge with the BCG. The merge occurs after a ‘survival time’ after which its stars and gas are subsumed into the central galaxy. This final galaxy merger can lead to a collisional starburst, the size of which depends on the ratio of galaxy baryonic masses.

#### Definitions
- *Identify time* is the last time that a galaxy that merges on to the main branch is larger than a third of the mass of the main progenitor.
- *Extended identity* time is the last time that the sum of  the masses of progenitors merging onto the main branch was larger than a third of the mass of the main progenitor.
- *Assembly time* is the time when the main progenitor has assembled half the final stellar mass of the BCG.
- *Formation time* is the time at which the total stellar mass of all progenitors at a given time is greater than half the final BCG mass.

#### A case study
The authors look at a single BCG as a case study. They note that the main branch does not represent the galaxy itself; a galaxy should be viewed ‘as the ensemble of its progenitors at [a] given time’.

The stars that end up in a BCG today formed at very high redshift. In the case study, the BCG reaches half its final mass at z~0.5, however the stellar mass of all progenitors that will eventually end up in the BCG reaches half the final BCG mass at z~5.

Most of the BCG stars were not formed in situ but accreted through mergers: after z~4 mass growth of the main branch is only through mergers, as star formation has been killed off by AGN activity. Of these mergers, it is major mergers that contribute the most to the final stellar mass.

Less than 10% of the stars were formed during merger induced starbursts. This could be due to the star formation prescription used for discs.

The assembly history of the BCG closely follows the evolution of the dark matter and stellar content of its host halo. There is a delay due to dynamical friction (it takes time for stuff to accrete on to the main progenitor).

The parent subhalo of the BCG accounts for 90% of the total dark matter mass in the FOF group, but only 35% of the total stellar content of the FOF group. In contrast, the 10% of dark matter substructures contain 65% of the stellar content.

Many substructures accreted below redshift 1 do not contribute their stellar mass to the BCG by redshift zero, suggesting there is much surviving stellar substructure in the halo at the present day.

#### Statistics of the BCG population
The authors then go on to look at the whole population of BCGs above some mass limit, identifying (~135 objects).

Observations of BCGs suggest small dispersion in luminosities and similar stellar populations at low z, which is interpreted as being due to the similar formation histories of such objects. The model recreates this small dispersion.

Only 40% of BCGs has their last major merger before z=1, 65% before z~0.5. The identity of the main progenitor ‘is thus ill defined before z~0.7’.

10% of BCGs have assembled half their mass before z~1. In contrast, almost 100% of the stars that will eventually become part of the BCG are formed before z~4. ‘Indicates that all our BCGs have uniformly old stellar populations’. Ellipticals do not share this difference between formation and assembly times.

For progenitors with masses greater than $10^{10} M_{\odot}$, the majority have low gas fractions. At higher z some have residual gas (these objects also have residual star formation and relatively blue colours), but the majority are gas poor at all redshifts. The metallicity distribution doesn’t evolve with redshift.

Below z~3, the majority of objects accreted on to the main branch have an early-type morphology.

The main progenitor of a BCG is not necessarily the most massive progenitor at a given redshift.

The stellar mass distribution of progenitors of local BCGs is broader and skewed to lower masses with increasing redshift.

#### Evolution of High X-ray Luminosity BCGs
The authors now look at the photometric properties of the BCGs. Results in this section can change dramatically given different supernovae feedback models.

The low-z model BCGs match the same range of k-band magnitudes as observations.

The predicted mass growth appears in contradiction with observations, but this neglects selection effects: high-z, high mass clusters are rarer than in the local universe, and their mass growth is in line with model predictions.

Lower mass systems have greater mass growth than high mass systems (which are more passive).

Colour-magnitude (AB) and stellar mass-metallicity relations show very little slope at any redshift.

#### Hierarchical Evolution
‘High-z BCGS are not necessarily the progenitors of local ones’.

‘70% of BCGs at z=2 do not become part of local BCGs, and this does not depend strongly on the mass of their host haloes’. High-z BCGs still end up in massive galaxies in massive halos at z=0. They are not necessarily a different population, just don’t make the particular mass cut used in this study.

High-z BCGs have similar mass distributions as the high mass progenitors of local BCGs, but are not necessarily the same objects.
