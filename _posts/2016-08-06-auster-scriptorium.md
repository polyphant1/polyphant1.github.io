excerpt: Thoughts on Auster's 2006 novella

I haven't read any Paul Auster before 'Travels in the Scriptorium'. This is important, as I believe it's the source of pretty much all my criticisms of this book. I really enjoyed the graphic novel adaptation of City of Glass, but apart from that I've only anecdotal evidence of Auster's brilliance as a writer.

Other reviews have highlighted the self-referential nature of this novella, and I'm sure that for die hard Auster fans this will be both exciting and comforting. But for fresh readers it's at best confusing, at worst simply boring.

The main character is intensely dislikable, and his interactions with the other guests are incomprehensible given his behaviour to them, unless the message behind the story has completely sailed me by, or there is important latent meaning from other novels that I'm unaware of.

The only saving grace was the story-in-a-story about the 'Confederation', a masquerade of early nineteenth century America. Near the end the main character is encouraged in to deconstructing this story academically, providing a glimpse in to Auster's views on literature as a craft, a meta-analysis of the birth of a thriller.

In summary, unless you've read Auster before, avoid. It may end up putting you off his other work. For my part, I may return to this after trying some of his other works. But be warned, Paul, you're on thin ice right now.
