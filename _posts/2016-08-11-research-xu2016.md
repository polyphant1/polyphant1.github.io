> *I have a bad habit of keeping lots of interesting research papers open in a long line of tabs in my browser. I am loath to close any of them, but the sight of it is not good for my well being every time I want to browse the internet. To alleviate my suffering, from now on I endeavour to read at least one each weekday, and blog a brief summary. These summaries do not represent an endorsement of the research contained in the chosen paper, and the choice is arbitrary based on what I find interesting on a given day. Any of the content is liable to misinterpretation or misrepresentation: if you want to know exactly what the authors said, go check out the paper and make your own mind up.*

### [X-ray Background at High Redshifts from Pop III Remnants: Results from Pop III star formation rates in the Renaissance Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02664v1)

Pop III stars$^{1}$ are not believed to be a major contributor to the reionisation UV photon budget. However, X-rays from PopIII stars (isolated or in binaries) or Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs), which have a longer mean free path, have been proposed as good candidates for pre-ionisation and pre-heating of the IGM. The authors, in a previous paper, showed how PopIII binaries might be the dominant X-ray sources at high-z, and show that the IGM could be heated by these sources on global scales - important for understanding the linewidths of Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra, and the signature of the high-z 21cm line from neutral Hydrogen. In this paper they assume that PopIII stars can continue to form right up to the end of reionisation, and calculate the resulting X-ray background and it's effect on the global heating of the IGM.

They use the Renaissance simulation suite, based on the AMR code ENZO.

The summarise the following results:

> 1) A significant amount of X-rays may be produced by Pop III binaries down to the end of reionization, as a direct result of Pop III stars forming continuously with steady rates since they begin forming at redshifts of 20âˆ’30.

> 2) The X-ray background builds up gradually once the first stars begin forming. The X-ray background intensity depends on the assumed source photon energies. Only keV photons contribute to the X-ray background, and become a broad band spectrum in the background.

> 3) X-rays from Pop III binaries might continuously dominate X-rays from normal stellar X-ray binaries and AGN until the end of reionization, although this conclusion depends on the assume

They make an interesting observation: whilst the energy budget of UV photons is much higher, these photons are typically consumed in high density regions to maintain the ionisation state, whereas X-ray photons can penetrate to lower density regions, where recombination times can be longer than the Hubble time.
