Additional to this <a href="/blog/">blog</a> I also write for <a href="http://astrobites.org/" target="blank">Astrobites</a>, where postgraduates in Astronomy and Astrophysics write about the latest research in an accessible format for undergraduates or the public in general. You can read my posts <a href="http://astrobites.com/author/clovell/" target="blank">here</a>.
